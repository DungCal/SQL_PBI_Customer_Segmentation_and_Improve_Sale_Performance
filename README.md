## I. Introduction 

### 1. Business Context

Adventure Works Cycles, a large, multinational manufacturing company, produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to North American, European, and Asian commercial markets. While its base operation is located in Bothell, Washington, and employs 500 people, several regional sales teams are located throughout the company's market region. In 2000, Adventure Works Cycles bought a small manufacturing plant, Wide World Importers, which is located in Mexico City, Mexico. Wide World Importers manufactures several critical subcomponents for the Adventure Works Cycles product line. These subcomponents are shipped to the Bothell location for final product assembly. In 2001, Wide World Importers became the sole manufacturer and distributor of the touring bicycle product group.
After a successful fiscal year, Adventure Works Cycles is looking to broaden its market share by focusing its sales efforts on the company's best customers, and reducing the cost of sales by reducing production costs.

### 2. Business Question 
 **1.1 Customer segmentation and profiling** 
 
 The sales team needs to be able to extract valuable information from raw data available in the databases to answer questions such as the following:
- What are the early warning signs of problems?
- Who are the best customers across all product lines? With whom should the sales team focus its efforts for building long-term relationships?
- What are customers' issues, categorized according to demographic groups (geographic location, revenue history, and so on)?
- What products are the customers buying and at what rate?

**1.2 Sales performance** 

When analyzing the insights of Sales Performance, the manager will comprehend the trend of the performance of each region through time series analysis, and recognize the region as either the potential one or not. Then, they will be supported to make good decisions for business strategies.
